# Lingkar Hijau

Lingkar Hijau is a website-based information system created with the aim of educating the public as well as being an information medium for tree planting. This application can function as a media link directly to people who want to plant trees but are constrained by location or so on. Thus, the information we display is not only about the importance of tree planting, but also includes information about the progress of tree planting that is being carried out.
